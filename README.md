Overview:
This library provides various linear algebra operations including matrix-vector operations, matrix-matrix operations, linear equation solving, norms, and inner products. 
The library is implemented in C++ using templates to handle various data types.

Features:
1. Matrix-Vector Operations
1.1. Matrix-vector multiplication
1.2. Vector addition and subtraction
1.3. Multiplication of a vector by a scalar

2. Matrix-Matrix Operations
2.1. Matrix addition and subtraction
2.2. Matrix multiplication
2.3. Matrix inversion (currently implemented for 2x2 matrices)
   
3. Linear Equation Solving
3.1. Solving systems of linear equations
3.2. Finding the eigenvalues of a matrix (currently implemented for 2x2 matrices)
   
4. Norms and Inner Products
4.1. Calculating the norm of a vector or matrix
4.2. Calculating the inner product of two vectors

How to Use:

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
g++ -o linear_algebra linear_algebra.cpp

Run the executable:
./linear_algebra
